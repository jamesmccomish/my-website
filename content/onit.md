Onit is a prediction market protocol that lets anyone deploy configurable prediction markets for any question.

A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/12/distribution-markets">paper</a> from Paradigm explored the idea of 'continuous outcome' prediction markets where traders can bet on exact values, and set a (normal) distribution to express their confidence around that number. We researched the idea and eventually built the first example of an 'infinite outcome' prediction market. It's a new market mechanism that overcomes many of the limitations of existing prediction markets, and even unlocks some fun new styles of market.

We have built the smart contracts, an API, and an SDK that anyone can use to deploy their own markets, and a few teams are already using these.

Onit is a work in progress, so you can follow our updates <a target="_blank" href="https://paragraph.com/@onit/">here</a> and check out our active markets <a target="_blank" href="https://onit.fun">here</a>.
