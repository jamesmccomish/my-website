Megaparlay is a parlay betting platform built on the <a target="_blank" href="https://conditional-tokens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/motivation.html">Conditional Token Framework</a> (CTF). 

V1 is a simple jackpot style mechanism where users pick sets of 6 outcomes, and the first user to correctly complete a parlay wins the entire prize pool up to that point.

For now outcome data comes from the Polymarket API, but any condition prepared on the CTF would work. The app is mainly built as a Farcaster miniapp, but can be accessed from the website and used by connecting any wallet.
